Week 12: Programming Assignment 2

Question:
There are `n` people who start in a happy state. The following rules determine how people move between states after each iteration:
- A person in the happy state has a 70% chance of moving to a sad state, and a 30% chance of staying in the happy state.
- A person in the sad state has a 50% chance of moving to a happy state, and a 50% chance of staying in the sad state.

Write a program that computes the number of people in the happy and sad states after 3 iterations.
Input Format:
A single integer `n` representing the number of people who start in the happy state.
Output Format:
Two integers separated by a space, where the first integer is the number of people in the happy state and the second is the number of people in the sad state after the 3rd iteration.
Example:
Input:
1000

Output:
412 588

Explanation:
State 0: 1000 0
State 1: 300 700
State 2: 440 560
State 3: 412 588

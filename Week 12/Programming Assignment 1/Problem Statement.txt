Week 12: Programming Assignment 1

Question:
Write a recursive function named collatz that accepts a positive integer n as an argument, where 1 < n ≤ 32,000, 
and returns the number of times the Collatz function has to be applied repeatedly in order to first reach 1.

The Collatz function is defined as follows:

If n is even, divide n by 2.
If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1.
The function should continue applying this process until n becomes 1, and return the number of steps taken.

Input Format:
A single integer n where 1 < n ≤ 32,000.

Output Format:
A single integer representing the number of steps required for n to reach 1.

Example:
Input:
12

Output:
9

Problem Statement:
Write a program that accepts a positive integer n and prints the sum of all prime numbers in the range [1, n], including both endpoints. 
If there are no prime numbers in the given range, the program should print 0.

Input Format:
A single integer n, representing the upper limit of the range.
Output Format:
A single integer representing the sum of all prime numbers in the range [1, n]. If no prime numbers are found, output 0.
Example:
Input:
10
Output:

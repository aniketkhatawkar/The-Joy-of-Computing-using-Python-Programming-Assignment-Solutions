Week 6: Programming Assignment 3

Question
Write a Python program that includes a recursive function named non_decreasing which takes a non-empty list L of integers as input. 
The function should return True if the elements in the list are sorted in non-decreasing order from left to right, and False otherwise.

Input Format:
The input consists of a single line containing space-separated integers that form the list L.

Output Format:
The output consists of a single boolean value (True or False) indicating whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example:

Input:
1 2 2 3 4

Output:
True

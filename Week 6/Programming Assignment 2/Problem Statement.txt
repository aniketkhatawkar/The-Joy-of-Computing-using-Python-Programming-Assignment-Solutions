Week 6: Programming Assignment 2

Question:
Write a Python program that takes a positive integer x as input and returns the logarithm of x to the base 2 using a recursive function. 
The logarithm of x to the base 2, denoted by log₂(x), is the number of times 2 has to be multiplied by itself to get x. Assume that x is a power of 2.

Input Format:
The input consists of a single positive integer x which is a power of 2.

Output Format:
The output consists of a single integer representing log₂(x).

Example:

Input:
8

Output:
3

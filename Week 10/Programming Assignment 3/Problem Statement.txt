Week 10: Programming Assignment 3

Question:
Write a program that accepts a space-separated string of integers representing a sequence of even length. The program should determine whether the sequence is left-heavy, right-heavy, or balanced. It should print:

-1 if the sequence is left-heavy (left half sum > right half sum).
1 if the sequence is right-heavy (right half sum > left half sum).
0 if the sequence is balanced (both sums are equal).
Input Format:
The input consists of a single line containing space-separated integers.
Output Format:
A single integer: -1 for left-heavy, 1 for right-heavy, or 0 for balanced.
Example:
Input:
1 2 3 4 5 6
Output:
1

Week 7: Programming Assignment 1

Question
You are given a board game scenario with ladders and snakes. A player starts at a given position on the board, and you are provided with the result of a die roll. 
You need to determine whether the player lands on a ladder, a snake, or a normal block after moving.

Write a Python function named move_player that takes four inputs:

A list ladders containing the indices of blocks with ladders.
A list snakes containing the indices of blocks with snakes.
An integer current_position representing the player's current position on the board.
An integer die_roll representing the result of a die roll.
The function should return:

1 if the player lands on a block with a ladder,
-1 if the player lands on a block with a snake,
0 if the player lands on a block with neither.
Take necessary inputs, pass the inputs to the function, and print the return value of the function.
Input Format
The input consists of four lines:

The first line contains space-separated integers representing the ladder indices.
The second line contains space-separated integers representing the snake indices.
The third line contains a single integer representing the current position of the player.
The fourth line contains a single integer representing the die roll result.
Output Format
The output consists of a single integer (1, -1, or 0) as per the conditions mentioned above.

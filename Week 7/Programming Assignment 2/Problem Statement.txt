Week 7: Programming Assignment 2

Question

Write a Python program that includes a recursive function named is_palindrome which takes a non-empty string s as input. 
The function should return 1 if the string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), and 0 otherwise.

Take necessary inputs, pass the inputs to the function, and print the return value of the function.


Input Format:

The input consists of a single line containing the string s.

Output Format:

The output consists of a single integer value (1 or 0) indicating whether the string is a palindrome.

Example:

Input:
racecar

Output
1

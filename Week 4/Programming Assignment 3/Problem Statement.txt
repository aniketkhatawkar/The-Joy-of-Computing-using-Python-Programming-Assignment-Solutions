Week 4: Programming Assignment 3
Create a Python program that checks whether a given square matrix is skew-symmetric. A matrix is skew-symmetric if its transpose is equal to the negative of the matrix itself, i.e AT=âˆ’A. 
The program should prompt the user to input the dimensions of the matrix and then input the matrix elements. The program should then determine whether the matrix is skew-symmetric and print 1 if it is, otherwise print 0.

Input Format:
The first input is an integer r , the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
The next r lines each contain r integers, representing the elements of each row of the matrix.


Output Format:
The output is 1 if a matrix is skew-symmetric, otherwise 0.


Example:

Input:

3
0 2 -1
-2 0 -4
1 4 0

Output:
1

Week 4: Programming Assignment 1

Create a Python program that identifies the presence of a "saddle point" in a given matrix. A saddle point is defined as an element in the matrix that is the smallest in its row and the largest in its column. The matrix is represented as a nested list, where each nested list corresponds to a row of the matrix. The program should determine if at least one saddle point exists in the matrix. If a saddle point is found, the program/function should print 1; otherwise, it should print 0.

Input Format:
The first input is an integer r , the number of rows in the matrix.
The second input is an integer c, the number of columns in the matrix.
The next r lines each contain c integers, representing the elements of each row of the matrix.


Output Format:
The output is 1 if a saddle point exists, otherwise 0.


Example:

Input:

3
3
2 0 3
2 1 4
4 2 6

Output:
1

Reason:
Element 2 in third row and second column is minimum in its row and maximum in its column.
So, it is a saddle point.

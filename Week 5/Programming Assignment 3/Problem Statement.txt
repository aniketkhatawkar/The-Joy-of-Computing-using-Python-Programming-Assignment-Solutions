Week 5: Programming Assignment 3

Create a Python program that finds the k-th largest and k-th smallest elements in a list of integers. 
The program should prompt the user to input a list of integers and a value `k`. The program should then find and print:

1 if the k-th largest and k-th smallest elements are the same and are at the middle of the sorted list.
 -1 if the k-th largest and k-th smallest elements are the same but are not in the middle of the sorted list.
0 if the k-th largest and k-th smallest elements are different.
Input Format:
The first line of input consists of a space-separated list of integers.
The second line of input consists of a single integer k.

Output Format:
The output consists of a single integer 1, -1, or 0 based on the conditions specified.

Example:

Input:
3 8 7 5 9 1
2

Output:
0

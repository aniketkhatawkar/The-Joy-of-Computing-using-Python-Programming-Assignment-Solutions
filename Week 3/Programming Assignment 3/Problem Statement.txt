Create a Python program that takes a list of integers, reverses the list, adds the values at odd indices from both the original and reversed lists, and creates a new list with the result. The new list should be printed in the end.

Input Format:
The input consists of a single list of integers, separated by spaces.

Output Format:
The output consists of the new list of values, separated by spaces, obtained by adding values at odd indices from both the original and reversed lists.
